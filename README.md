# Project Fetal Health Classification

Analysis of the fetal health classification dataset from Kaggle using unsupervised learning and multi-class classification. We used k-means, hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) to visualize the data and then classification using RandomForest and SVM. 

Project done with Justin Collins and Matt Nicholson for STAT432: Basics of Statistical Learning at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in Spring 2021.
